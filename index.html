            <p>HTML is cool </p>
            <p>CSS is cooler</p>
            <p>JavaScript is the best</p> 
            
            <p>What do you need to create a website?</p>
            
                Not much!
                A computer (always a good start),
                A text editor (I am using atom),
                A web browser (I am using chrome),
                Some HTML, CSS and JS files.
