        <p>"I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the 
            internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
            Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why..."</p>

        <p>HTML is cool
            CSS is cooler
            JS is the best
            
            What do you need to create a website?
            
            Not much!
            A computer (always a good start)
            A text editor (I am using atom)
            A web browser (I am using chrome)
            Some HTML, CSS and JS files
